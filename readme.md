Hello, this is repo would be stored articles I think worth. If something illegal you think there is, please notice me, I would remove it immediately.

## Why

What we ignored is, the web is really week, one research[^web-page-research] published in 2024, said 38% of webpages that existed in 2013 are no longer accessible a decade later.

Why 10 years? I think one reason is that is upper limit you could renewal it. But what we leave now? Just go http://web.archive.org to look what has gone (personal blog). And look around you what remains today (business content).

I want leave here something really should be shared, not goods, not ideology, not hatred. We could not be so smart.

## How

I want using the Github Action, Github Webhook and Telegram Bot to archive content with Markdown. They should from:

- Repo: we could use submodule import it.
- Blog: we could use rss fetch it every day.
- Social Media: in bluesky or mastodon, we still could use rss. Whereas towards traditional services, we only could use custom method to get content(anti-crawling)

## What

So this is what may I want to archived:

- Die People/Website
