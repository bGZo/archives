# Archive

Hello, this is repo that would be stored articles I think it worth from internet. If something illedge you think there is,  notice me, I would remove it immediately.

## Why

What's we ignore is, the web content is really weekness, with time going by, more and more articles would be disappered. So 10 years, which means a domain could be keep up to years avaiable, is a suitable number to calculate.

One research published in 2024, said 38% of webpages that existed in 2013 are no longer accessible a decade later. Just go web.archive.org to look what has gone (personal blog). And look around you what remains today (business content).

## How

I want using the Github Action, Webhook and Telegram Bot to archive content with Mardown. They may contains following sources:

- github: submodule as much as possible.
- blog: rss fetch.
- social media: using custom method to get content(anti-crawling).

## Todo list

- api repo
- resource repo
